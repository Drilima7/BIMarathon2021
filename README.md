# BIMarathon2021
This project mission is to show how the pandemic has affected young students and their environment.
With the impact of covid-19 most students started to study from home instead of going to the physical school. And knowing that the level of stress is higher now, we will use this data to analize the student's level of stress before the start of the pandemic, and how it impacted the new situation.


We will analize the young students situation, such as school type, age, gender, nivel of stress before the pandemic and how many studants had their envronment changed from in person to virtual school.
